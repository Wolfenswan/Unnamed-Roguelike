===============================================================

This game was created as a continuation of the (revised) Roguebasin Roguelike Tutorial.
By now it has grown into a beast of its own, sporting various gameplay elements that were never introduced during the original tutorial.

As it is still in very early development - in fact, it might never see a proper release, being primarily a pet project of mine.
There is little in terms of story, balance is probably nonexistent and kinks are expected. Nevertheless, the master branch should always
be playable in one way or another.

The Roguelike I have in mind would feel and play very familiarly to traditional members of the genre (shocker!), while
making combat somewhat faster, slightly more dynamic and maybe even a bit arcade-like. Examples of this would be dodging and blocking
being active actions, rather than passive stats.

# GOAL OF THE GAME #
tba

# STAMINA & EXHAUSTION #
Your stamina indicates your current ability to fight, defend yourself and do other actions.
As you exhaust yourself through doing these actions you fighting abilities will worsen, until ultimately you will be
unable to do anything.
Resting, both during and outside of combat, will replenish your stamina, although at a lower rate when enemies are nearby.

# DODGING/DASHING #
To dash out of harms way, toggle your (d)ashing and move as usual. Your character will attempt to move two spaces.
If they are intercepted by an enemy attempt a tackle for some light damage, possibly dazing them.
The exhaustion caused by dashing is primarily governed by the weight of your armor.

# BLOCKING #
To block an attack you need to (r)aise your shield and anticipate it. A successful block will reduce the damage you take
and possibly daze the attacker.

# ITEM USAGE DURING COMBAT #
Items have to be prepared if you want to use them during combat. To do this,
interact with an item in your (i)ventory and (p)repare it. Then use the number
keys to activate a prepared item during combat. You can only prepare a limited
number of items, depending on the quick-use slots of your equipment. There's no
limitation on item usage outside of combat.
