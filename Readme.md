**RoguelikeTutorial - TCOD**

A from-ground-up libtcod rework of my 2017 attempt (using the by now deprecated TDL), with a bit more starting experience and a better of hold of which concepts I want to implement and how to implement them.

Still, this might never turn into a full game, but until then it's a Python playground of various proofs-of-concept.
