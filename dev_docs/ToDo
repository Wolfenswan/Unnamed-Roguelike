CURRENT
- add descriptions to monsters depending on modifiers (e.g. scrawny: it looks unusually weak for its kind)
X add throwing dagger
X add to (s)earch screen: what's on the ground below an actor
    - standalone window (with no actor is not necessary: would create clutter and the objects window already indictaes objects below cursor with *)
- add pydispatch to do spawning properly without circular import
- add dlvl-check to level-generation (implemented in data, needs check in code)

- Tweak Dungeon generation
    - ideally should be a mix between dungeon & tunnels
        - options dungeon (only tunnels & square rooms), caves (only drunk walk), mines (mix of both)
    - use drunk_tunneling to color areas
- Balancing pass for first release
    - chaff monsters much weaker
    - monsters better spread throughout levels
- Queen boss monster
    - maybe allow queen to spit eggs instead of ranged attack?
        - lobbed ranged attack that cant miss?
    - set end state after defeating
    - show final screen after exiting through portal
    - Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
            - maybe protected by queen/boss?
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?

BUGS
X dung beatle still charge odd angles

ITEMS
- add incendiary effect
    - create "flame" entity; passable but damages
- shoes, rings, backpacks, (shoulders)
- abstract weight system: (almost)weightless/light/moderate/heavy/v.heavy
    - avoids need for number crunching
    - easy modifiers for exhaustion
    - bespoke items could be put one category lower

COMBAT
- bombs/projectiles exploding after n turns
- mines/traps as items
    - not triggered by player
- ranged combat
    - consider always allowing a ranged weapon, indp. from melee weapon/offhand OR disallow both melee & ranged being two-handed
    - add reloadable weapons
        - e.g. crossbow, guns
        - EMPTY indicator in GUI
        - reload by "waiting"
    - some weapons can be fired with enemies nearby
        - e.g. crossbow, guns (but not reloaded)

ENTITIES
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- AI Skill
    - give skills a weight to prefer one over the other
- steel fence with portcullis parting a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
- Light sources
    - static torches/lamps
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV

GUI
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
    Manual
    - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    - rename STR(ength) to POW(er)?

REFACTORING/CODE
- can lowering exploration value make a comeback?
- weighted item generation for containers:
    - less chance for each item towards the cap
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14992521/python-weighted-random
    - https://oroboro.com/non-uniform-random-numbers/
- rewrite turn_processing lists -> dict
    - write new class "Turn", carrying all relevant information
        - game as owner
        - method end() to clean out turn
        - 'messages' : value list containing all messages to display

FUTURE
- add prefab rooms (e.g. for portal enter room)
- decouple max/min dungeon size from screen width
